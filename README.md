# Whisper-Network
A browser extension to allow users to create and manage their contribution to a network of trusted and blocked sites.

Inspired from a post I made on a webforum I frequent:

|I want a browser extension called “Personal Whisper Network”. Pushing the PWN button pops open a control panel for the current web page:
|TRUST adds a page to your personal trustlist, and BLOCK adds a page to your personal blocklist.
|
|If you have a page of your own, whenever you update your trustlist or blocklist, you’re encouraged to access the WIDGET panel, which 
|generates custom code for your website. Putting the Whisper Network widget on your site works kind of like a webring from the old days. 
|Non-WN browsers can just click it to be taken to a random page on your trustlist, but if another PWN user adds your page to their 
|trustlist, your own trustlist and blocklist are inherited as second-order trusted and blocked sites, and any second-order lists for that 
|site get added to your third-order lists, etc. This continues for up to six orders.
|
|At any time, you can click the PWN extension to hit the RANDOM button for random 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th-order trusted site. Note that 
|higher order blocks override lower-order trust, and vice versa.
